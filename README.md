Pile of Shaders
======

Exactly what it says on the tin. Just a collections of hopefully at least somewhat interesting shaders I've written/will write in various different projects. They're not production ready at all and usually also pretty inefficient.

These will (probably) all come from Unity projects across various versions I'm not even keeping track of. Things may work, or may not work in your version. I'm also going for "works on my machine"-approach, not using the proper tools like [`UNITY_REVERSED_Z` and friends](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-PlatformDifferences.html). These shaders are very much not production ready.

Also, they're in just one giant unorganised pile. Mainly because some things will probably be dependencies of multiple other things, without me knowing about it just yet.

Note that almost everything here is [unlicense](./UNLICENSE)-licensed. Go ham. Except if that ham lives in the realm of production ready software. The files not unlicensed have this mentioned at the top of their files, and are also listed here for convenience:
